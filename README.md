# TFSA Contribution Room Calculator

This Python exercise, `script3.py`, calculates the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution room based on the user's birth year. The contribution room is the total amount that an individual is allowed to contribute to their TFSA.

## Usage

## Run the script using PyCharm or your terminal:

1. The script will prompt you to enter your birth year.

2. Enter your birth year as an integer (e.g., 2000).

3. The program will calculate your TFSA contribution room based on the rules provided.

4. If you entered an incorrect birth year or if you were younger than 18 in 2009, the program will display an appropriate message.

## Example Output

```
Please enter your birth year: 2000
Your age is 22 and you turned 18 in 2018
Your TFSA Contribution is: $29500
Thank you for checking
```
